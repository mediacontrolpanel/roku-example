# roku-example

This repository holds and example configuration for a Roku app that streams an example ABR broadcast from [MediaCP Cloud Video](https://www.mediacp.net/cloud-video/): https://demo-company.mycloudstream.io/public/viducc7f

Editing the main.brs and MainScrene.brs files to use your own HLS link should allow for your own stream to be seen, further branding can be achieved by replacing the images with your own and editing the Manifest file. Work is still needed to submit the app to Roku, so please follow our detailed guide on our website: [Build and Publish Custom Roku Channel App](https://www.mediacp.net/doc/other/build-and-publish-custom-roku-channel-app/)
